        <p>
          I am an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology,
          Kharagpur majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering. I am a part
          of the Students’ Branding and Relations Cell and member of the
          embedded team at Aerial Robotics Kharagpur.

          I’ve spent the past 2+ years working across different areas of web
          development : frontend, backend and database management. Currently I
          am exploring the concepts of deep learning and the applications of
          computer vision in drones. In my leisure time, you’ll find me playing
          either the keyboard, ukulele or guitar, and watching formula one
          races.
